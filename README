Python 2.7.7

Here is a Kerbal Space Program Maneuver calculator I developed. After importing the program file, execute the .run() function to being. 

With this tool you’re about to calculate:
-Energy required for Hohmann Transfers
-Energy required for Planetary Transfers
-Energy required for Moon Transfers
-Celestial body escape velocity
-Orbital periods
-Orbital velocities
-How much time is spent on the dark side of a celestial body. 

The calculator is run entirely through the terminal. Tkinter frameworks hopefully coming soon. 

I know there are already a number of better tools already available, but I’m new to coding and decided this would be a fun project. ANY AND ALL RECOMMENDATIONS are welcomed!
